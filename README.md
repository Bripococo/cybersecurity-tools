# üß∞ Cybersecurity Tools by Brian

This repository showcases a modular suite of Python-based tools designed for embedded security validation, threat simulation, and forensic analysis across IoT, SCADA, and SOAR environments.
Each project reflects a distinct operational layer‚Äîfrom protocol fingerprinting and cryptographic auditing to behavioral mapping and execution chain validation‚Äîbuilt with reproducibility, multi-issue reporting, and scenario-driven logic at its core.
