# 🧰 Cybersecurity Tools by Brian

This repository showcases a modular suite of Python-based tools designed for embedded security validation, threat simulation, and forensic analysis across IoT, SCADA, and SOAR environments.
Each project reflects a distinct operational layer—from protocol fingerprinting and cryptographic auditing to behavioral mapping and execution chain validation—built with reproducibility, multi-issue reporting, and scenario-driven logic at its core.
